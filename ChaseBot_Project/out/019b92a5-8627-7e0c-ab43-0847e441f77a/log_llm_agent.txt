AGENT: LLM Agent is running. Waiting for game state...

==================== AGENT: Asking LLM ====================
AGENT: Current State:
**Current State:**
- PlayerBot: 
  - Position: ({{ player_x | round(1) }}, {{ player_y | round(1) }})
  - Angle: {{ player_angle | round(1) }} degrees
- TargetBot: 
  - Position: ({{ target_x | round(1) }}, {{ target_y | round(1) }})

**Your Task:**
1.  **Analyze**: Calculate the vector (difference in x, y) from the player to the target.
2.  **Think**: Based on the vector and your current angle, decide the best action. Should you turn first, or move forward? Is the target already aligned?
3.  **Act**: Issue ONE command to get closer to the target.

**Available Actions & JSON Format:**
- To **turn**, use the "navigate" action with an "angle". A positive angle means turning right, a negative angle means turning left.
  Example: `{"action": "navigate", "parameters": {"angle": "45deg"}}`
- To **move**, use the "navigate" action with a "direction" and "distance".
  Example: `{"action": "navigate", "parameters": {"direction": "front", "distance": "50cm"}}`

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- Issue only ONE command at a time.
- Prioritize turning to face the target before moving. If you are not facing the target, TURN first.
- Provide your response as a single JSON object. Do not add any text before or after the JSON.

**Example Thought Process:**
*Thought: The target is at (600, 200) and I am at (100, 100) facing 0 degrees (East). The target is to my North-East. I need to turn left towards it first. I will issue a command to turn left.*

1.  **Analyze**: Calculate the vector (difference in x, y) from the player to the target.
2.  **Think**: Based on the vector and your current angle, decide the best action. Should you turn first, or move forward? Is the target already aligned?
3.  **Act**: Issue ONE command to get closer to the target.

**Available Actions & JSON Format:**
- To **turn**, use the "navigate" action with an "angle". A positive angle means turning right, a negative angle means turning left.
  Example: `{"action": "navigate", "parameters": {"angle": "45deg"}}`
- To **move**, use the "navigate" action with a "direction" and "distance".
  Example: `{"action": "navigate", "parameters": {"direction": "front", "distance": "50cm"}}`

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- Issue only ONE command at a time.
- Prioritize turning to face the target before moving. If you are not facing the target, TURN first.
- Provide your response as a single JSON object. Do not add any text before or after the JSON.

2.  **Think**: Based on the vector and your current angle, decide the best action. Should you turn first, or move forward? Is the target already aligned?
3.  **Act**: Issue ONE command to get closer to the target.

**Available Actions & JSON Format:**
- To **turn**, use the "navigate" action with an "angle". A positive angle means turning right, a negative angle means turning left.
  Example: `{"action": "navigate", "parameters": {"angle": "45deg"}}`
- To **move**, use the "navigate" action with a "direction" and "distance".
  Example: `{"action": "navigate", "parameters": {"direction": "front", "distance": "50cm"}}`

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- Issue only ONE command at a time.
- Prioritize turning to face the target before moving. If you are not facing the target, TURN first.
- Provide your response as a single JSON object. Do not add any text before or after the JSON.

**Example Thought Process:**
*Thought: The target is at (600, 200) and I am at (100, 100) facing 0 degrees (East). The target is to my North-East. I need to turn left towards it first. I will issue a command to turn left.*
*JSON Output:*
`{"action": "navigate", "parameters": {"angle": "-45deg"}}`
